Today we added basic support for Erlang with R14B04 (Ubuntu 12.04 default)
and the latest version of Rebar. You can now choose Erlang during the
new project setup process:

We are new to the Erlang language, so please make sure you provide us 
feedback and let us know how we can improve your Erlang build environment.

### Java Updates

version of **JDK8**, in addition to previous versions of the language:

* OpenJDK 6
* OpenJDK 7
* **Sun JDK8**

### Python Updates

We also upgraded our Python build environments. You can now choose the latest
version of Python, in addition to previous versions of the language:

* Python 2.7
* Python 3.2
* **Python 3.3**

We also added basic support for some new database types:

* Neo4j
