Drone already supports some great deployment options, including Heroku,
Dotcloud and Google Appengine (beta). Today we're introducing a much more
generic option: **SSH deployments**.

With SSH deployments you can quickly deploy to any existing Linux server,
including popular server hosts like:

* Amazon EC2
* Rackspase
* Linode
* Digital Ocean

... pretty much any Linux server with SSH enabled

Drone makes automated testing and deployment dead simple. It's completely
**free for open source**, and **cheaper than hosting a Jenkins server**.
