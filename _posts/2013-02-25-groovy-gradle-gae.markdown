A few weeks ago Guillaume Laforge, the creator of Groovy, contacted us on 
[Google+](https://plus.google.com/114130972232398734985/posts/dxCoWnCu9DJ)
asking for Groovy, Gradle and Google AppEngine support:

We were up for the challenge! Today we are happy to announce support for
Groovy, Gradle and Google AppEngine for the Python and Java runtimes
(including JVM languages like Groovy, of course).

### Groovy

When creating new project, you will have the option to choose the Groovy
runtime. Included with the Groovy runtime are Gradle, Maven and Ant.

### Google AppEngine

Once your project is created, you can add an AppEngine deployment step. For
now, you will need to copy and paste your AppEngine refresh token, found in the
`.appcfg_oauth2_tokens` or `.appcfg_oauth2_tokens_java` file in your `$HOME`
directory:

And thatâ€™s it! Simple right?

Drone will traverse your project's directory structure, find and parse your
app.yaml, and execute the necessary commands to deploy your code.
