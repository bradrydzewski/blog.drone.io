One of the most frequent concerns for our users is our monthly build cap.
I can't tell you how many times I've gotten this email:

> I'm interested in purchasing a plan, however, I'm feeling like the monthly

We put these limits in place because, like most new services, we weren't sure
what to expect in terms of daily build volume and average build duration. Now
that we've been around for 5 months (wow time flies) we are happy to announce:

<span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:16px;">No more monthly build limits</span>
